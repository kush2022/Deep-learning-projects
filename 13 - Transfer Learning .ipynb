    "## Transfer Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "- is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is adapted or fine-tuned for a different but related task. \n",
    "- it involves taking a pre-trained model, usually from a large and diverse dataset, and using it as a starting point to train a new model on a smaller dataset or different but related problem. \n",
    "- Transfer learning is particularly powerful when you have limited data for your target task."

    "2. **Feature Extraction**\n",

    "3. **Fine Tuning**\n",
