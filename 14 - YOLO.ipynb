    "## YOLO \n",
    "- (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in an image or video stream. \n",
    "- What makes YOLO unique is its ability to perform oobject detection in a single pass through the neural network, making it extremely fast and efficient for real-time applications. \n",

    "**Here are some key features and concepts related to YOLO**\n",
    "1. **Single Shot Detection** \n",
    "- YOLO is a single-shot object detector meaning it processes the entire image in one forward pass through the neural network and makes predictions for all objects simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grid-Based Detection**\n",
    "- YOLO divides the input image into a grid of cells. \n",
    "- Each cell is responsible for predicting objects that fall within it.\n",
    "- For each cell, YOLO predicts bounding boxes, class probabilities, and objectness scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bounding Box Predictions**\n",
    "- YOLO predicts boundig boxes for each object. Each bounding box is defined by its coordinates(x,y) for the center box, its width (w) and its height (h)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Class Predictions**\n",
    "- YOLO assigns class probabilities to each bounding box, indicating the likelihood that the object in the box belongs to a particular class. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Objectness Score**\n",
    "- YOLO predicts an objectness score for each bounding box, which represents the confidence that an object is present within the box.\n",
    "- High objectness scores indicate high confidence in object detection. \n",
    "\n",
